  === tip 7 - pause with your brush off the page ===
  === tip 8 - chunk you undos ===
    * granularity of undo command can be controlled
      - change in insert mode and back to normal mode constitutes as a single change
  === tip 9 - compose repeatable changes ===
    * be mindful of how we compose changes
    * (aw) - text object - for entire word
      - (daw) - deletes a word
  === tip 10 - use counts to do simple arithmetic ===
    * (<c-a>) - does addition on the number - works from anywhere in the line
      - 10<c-a> 5 turns to 15
    * (<c-x>) - does subtraction on the number - works from anywhere in the line
      - 10<c-x> 50 turns to 40
  === tip 11 - dont count if you can repeat ===
  === tip 12 - combine and conquer ===
    * opertor + motion = action
      - d{motion} - (dl) - delete single character
