== The vim way ==
  === Tip 1 - The dot command ===
    * repeat the last change(.)
  === Tip 2 - Don't repeat yourself ===
    * append at the end(A)
    * new line above(O), new line below(o)
    * insert at the begininng of the line(I)
  === Tip 3 - Take one step back, then three forward ===
    * (s) - (cl) - change letter
    * f{char} - find the next occurence of char,
    * F{char} - find the previous occurence of char
    * t{char} - find the previous character to occurence of char
    * T {char} - find the next character to occurence of char backwards
    * repeat the last motion(;), in the reverse direction(,)
  === Tip 4 - Act, repeat, reverse ===
    * (u) - undo last change
    * /pattern<CR> - scan document for next pattern match
      - n to repeat
      - N to undo
    * ?pattern<CR> - scan document for previous pattern match
      - n to repeat
      - N to undo
    * :s/target/replacement - perform subsitution
      - (&) to repeat
      - u to undo
  === Tip 5 - Find and replace by hand ===
    * (*) - search for word under cursor
    * (cw) - change word
  === Tip 6 - Meet the dot formula ===
    * one keystroke for motion and one keystorke for change is optimal
